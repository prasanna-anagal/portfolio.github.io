    The problem space for the Healthcare Management System (HMS) was defined by identifying inefficiencies and challenges in critical healthcare operations in urban and rural settings. This analysis involved reviewing current healthcare processes and pinpointing areas where delays and resource mismanagement impacted patient care and system efficiency. The findings highlighted issues such as:
    <ul><br>
        <li>Lack of a systematic approach to categorizing and prioritizing medical emergencies, leading to delays in response times.</li>
        <li>Inadequate scheduling mechanisms for patient appointments, resulting in long waiting times and underutilization of resources.</li>
        <li>Inefficient inventory management of medical supplies, causing shortages during emergencies and overstocking of less critical items.</li>
        <li>Suboptimal allocation and dispatch of healthcare resources, such as ambulances and medical teams, due to unoptimized routing and availability checks.</li>
    </ul>

            The <strong>Healthcare Management System (HMS)</strong> is designed to optimize and streamline healthcare operations in a city, ensuring efficient and timely healthcare delivery to its citizens. It focuses on four critical modules:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emergency Incident Categorization:</strong> Efficiently categorizing and prioritizing medical emergencies to facilitate prompt responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Appointment Scheduling:</strong> Managing patient appointments systematically to reduce wait times and improve service efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Supply Inventory Management:</strong> Ensuring accurate tracking, management, and restocking of medical supplies to prevent shortages.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Resource Allocation:</strong> Strategically distributing healthcare resources to address urgent needs and ensure optimal utilization.</li>
            </ul>
            HMS employs advanced algorithms such as <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong>, <strong>Rabin-Karp string matching</strong>, <strong>QuickSort</strong>, <strong>Depth First Search (DFS)</strong>, <strong>Priority Queues</strong>, <strong>Binary Search Trees (BST)</strong>, and <strong>Union-Find</strong> to enhance operational efficiency and enable real-time decision-making. These algorithms are chosen for their ability to handle complex healthcare scenarios with scalability and practical efficiency.
