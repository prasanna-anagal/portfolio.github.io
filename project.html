                <div class="accordion-content">
                    The problem space focuses on optimizing urban mobility and infrastructure in growing cities. 
                    This was identified by analyzing inefficiencies in traffic flow, public transportation utilization, 
                    and the environmental impact of city logistics. The findings highlighted trends such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inefficient traffic patterns due to outdated signaling systems.</li>
                        <li>Underutilization of public transit due to poor accessibility and scheduling.</li>
                        <li>High carbon emissions caused by poorly optimized logistics networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Smart city designs, incorporating IoT sensors, AI-driven traffic management, and multimodal 
                    transportation systems, were explored to address these challenges.
