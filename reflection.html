                <div class="accordion-content">
    The kinds of problems we see in nature are often related to optimization, searching, sorting, pattern recognition, and dynamic systems. These include:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimization Problems:</strong> Problems that involve finding the best solution from a set of possible solutions. For example, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) seeks the shortest possible route for visiting multiple cities. This type of problem can be addressed using algorithms like Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Searching Problems:</strong> Finding specific elements within a collection, such as searching for a word in a dictionary. Algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search are often used to efficiently locate elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorting Problems:</strong> Organizing data in a particular order, such as arranging a list of numbers in ascending order. This is a common problem that can be solved using algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition Problems:</strong> Identifying patterns or structures within data, such as recognizing speech or handwriting. Algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) and Boyer-Moore are used for efficient string matching, a key part of pattern recognition.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Systems Problems:</strong> Problems that change over time, requiring algorithms that can adapt to these changes. Examples include traffic flow optimization or financial modeling. Dynamic Programming and Divide and Conquer strategies are commonly used to solve such problems efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

                <label for="item2" class="accordion-header">2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth.</label>
                <div class="accordion-content">
    <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. A space-efficient algorithm minimizes memory usage. For example, in-place sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort are space-efficient because they don’t require extra memory.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the time an algorithm takes to complete. More time-efficient algorithms minimize the number of operations, reducing execution time. For example, Merge Sort and Quick Sort are more time-efficient than Bubble Sort for large datasets.</li>

    <h3>Why are They Important?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Limited resources like memory may lead to overflows or inefficient performance if an algorithm uses excessive memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> The speed of an algorithm affects its practicality, especially for large datasets. Algorithms with poor time efficiency can cause delays or failures in real-time applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classes of Problems and Orders of Growth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>O(1) – Constant time:</strong> Independent of input size (e.g., accessing an array element).</li>
        <li><strong>O(log n) – Logarithmic time:</strong> Grows slowly (e.g., Binary Search).</li>
        <li><strong>O(n) – Linear time:</strong> Grows with input size (e.g., Linear Search).</li>
        <li><strong>O(n log n) – Linearithmic time:</strong> More efficient sorting (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).</li>
        <li><strong>O(n²) – Quadratic time:</strong> Grows with nested iterations (e.g., Bubble Sort).</li>
        <li><strong>O(2^n) – Exponential time:</strong> Grows rapidly, often impractical for large inputs (e.g., brute-force solutions).</li>
        <li><strong>O(n!) – Factorial time:</strong> Extremely slow for large inputs (e.g., brute-force N-Queens Problem).</li>
    </ul>

                <label for="item3" class="accordion-header">3. Takeaway from different design principles (Chapter 2)</label>
                <div class="accordion-content">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Takeaways from Design Principles:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Brute force solves problems by exhaustively trying all possible solutions. It's a straightforward approach but can be very inefficient, especially for large inputs. For example, linear search checks every element in the array until it finds the target or finishes checking all elements, making it O(n) in time complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Decrease and Conquer:</strong> This technique involves breaking down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem and solving them in a systematic manner. Binary search is a classic example where the problem size is reduced by half in each step, improving search time compared to brute force (O(log n) vs O(n)).</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Divide and conquer splits the problem into independent subproblems, solves them separately, and then combines their results. Merge Sort is a prime example, which divides an array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them back together, giving an efficient time complexity of O(n log n).</li>
        <li><strong>Transform and Conquer:</strong> This approach transforms the problem into a more manageable form. For instance, Heap Sort builds a heap structure from the input array and sorts it by repeatedly extracting the maximum element, which optimizes the sorting process compared to simpler algorithms like selection sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid recalculating the same thing multiple times. A classic example is the Fibonacci sequence, where using a simple recursive approach would be slow, but memoization stores previously computed values, improving efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Greedy Technique:</strong> Greedy algorithms work by making the best possible decision at each step, aiming for an overall optimal solution. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a good example where, at each step, the shortest unvisited node is chosen, eventually resulting in the shortest path from the source node in a graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Space and Time Trade-off:</strong> This technique aims to optimize both time and space. Memoization is a prime example, where intermediate results are stored in a cache (using extra space) to avoid redundant calculations, which ultimately saves time in recursive algorithms like those for the Fibonacci sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomized Algorithms:</strong> These algorithms rely on randomization to improve performance and handle certain problems more efficiently. Quick Sort is a typical example, where a random pivot element is chosen in each iteration, making the algorithm faster on average and reducing the worst-case performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Backtracking is a trial-and-error method that solves problems incrementally, undoing decisions when a solution path does not work out. It’s widely used in constraint satisfaction problems like the N-Queens problem, where you place queens on a chessboard and backtrack if a queen is placed in an invalid position.</li>
