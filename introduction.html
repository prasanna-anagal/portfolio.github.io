                    This course focuses on introducing students to the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for solving computational problems efficiently. Students will explore how different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, are used to organize and store data. Alongside, they will learn various algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimization, focusing on analyzing their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    In this course, we have studied a variety of essential data structures including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arrays: Simple, linear structures that store elements in a contiguous block of memory.</li>
                        <li>Linked Lists: A dynamic structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.</li>
                        <li>Stacks: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure useful for tasks like undo operations.</li>
                        <li>Queues: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure that supports operations like scheduling and task management.</li>
                        <li>Trees: Hierarchical data structures, such as binary trees and binary search trees (BST), that allow efficient searching and sorting.</li>
                        <li>Graphs: Structures representing networks of nodes and edges, useful in solving problems like shortest path and network connectivity.</li>
                        <li>Hash Tables: Used for fast data retrieval by mapping keys to values, enabling constant time complexity for lookups.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The algorithms covered in the course include searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), and optimization algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms).

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    The concepts learned in this course are directly applicable to real-world software development and technology. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data storage and retrieval:</strong> Hash tables are used in databases and caching mechanisms to provide fast access to data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigating networks:</strong> Graphs are fundamental in network routing algorithms, social networks, and web page rankings (e.g., Googleâ€™s PageRank).</li>
                        <li><strong>Search engines:</strong> Sorting and searching algorithms enable the indexing and querying of vast amounts of data, making information retrieval efficient.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI and machine learning:</strong> Algorithms like dynamic programming and greedy algorithms are essential in optimization problems, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and decision-making in AI systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>User interfaces and applications:</strong> Stacks and queues are used in managing user interactions and system processes (e.g., undo/redo operations or event handling).</li>
                    </ul>
